			<p> Climbing was one of the hardest and exiting trip trip.The bus took us from the hotel to Dahab. It was 1h driving.
				My team and I were very exiting. It was well-organized. we had Tea and lot of water because of the sun. We spent at least 
				2 hours climbing. Whit our guide, we had fun and learned a lot about Sharm history.
